# Login Redirect Debug Fix

## 🔍 Issue: Login Successful but Redirects Back to Admin

### **Problem Analysis:**
- Login is working (getting correct response)
- But authentication state isn't updating immediately
- Dashboard page redirects back to admin because `isAuthenticated` is still false
- This creates a redirect loop

## 🧪 Debug Steps

### **1. Open Browser DevTools**
- Press `F12` or right-click → "Inspect"
- Go to the **Console** tab
- Clear the console

### **2. Test Login Flow**
1. **Visit** `http://localhost:3000/admin`
2. **Enter credentials** and click "Sign In"
3. **Watch the console** for debug messages

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
Attempting login...
AuthContext: Login response received: {accessToken: "...", refreshToken: "...", user: {...}}
AuthContext: User state updated
AuthContext: Login completed, isAuthenticated should be true
Login successful, checking authentication state...
Current isAuthenticated: false  ← This might be the issue
Current authLoading: false
Forcing redirect to dashboard...
Dashboard page useEffect - isLoading: false, isAuthenticated: false  ← Issue here
Unauthorized access attempt to dashboard - redirecting to admin
```

## 🔧 Potential Fixes

### **Fix 1: Use window.location instead of router.push**
Replace the redirect in admin page with:

```typescript
// Instead of router.push('/dashboard')
window.location.href = '/dashboard';
```

### **Fix 2: Add delay before redirect**
```typescript
// After successful login
setTimeout(() => {
  router.push('/dashboard');
}, 500);
```

### **Fix 3: Force state update**
```typescript
// After login, force a state refresh
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
router.push('/dashboard');
```

## 🎯 Quick Test

### **Test the Current Issue:**
1. **Login with credentials**
2. **Check console output**
3. **Look for these specific messages:**
   - "Current isAuthenticated: false" ← This is the problem
   - "Dashboard page useEffect - isLoading: false, isAuthenticated: false"

### **If isAuthenticated is still false after login:**
The issue is that the authentication state isn't updating immediately. This could be due to:
- React state update timing
- API service token storage timing
- Context state synchronization

## 🚀 Immediate Fix

Let me implement a fix that uses `window.location` instead of Next.js router to bypass the state timing issue:

```typescript
// In admin page, replace router.push with:
window.location.href = '/dashboard';
```

This will force a full page navigation instead of client-side routing, which should bypass the authentication state timing issue.

## 📋 Debug Checklist

### **Check Authentication State:**
- [ ] Console shows "Login response received"
- [ ] Console shows "User state updated"
- [ ] Console shows "Current isAuthenticated: true" (not false)
- [ ] localStorage contains access token
- [ ] No redirect loop in console

### **If Still Not Working:**
- [ ] Check if tokens are being stored correctly
- [ ] Verify API service isAuthenticated() method
- [ ] Check for React state update timing issues
- [ ] Try window.location.href instead of router.push

The debug logs will show exactly where the authentication state is failing to update!
